# SwanEvolution
In this repository one can find a source code of an algorithm, described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08587).
We propose a robust evolutionary calibration approach that allows to build the stochastic ensemble of perturbed models and use it to achieve the trade-off  between quality and robustness of the model calibration results.
## More
REBEC (Robust Ensemble-Based Evolutionary Calibration of SWAN model) helps to obtain the forecasts and hindcasts of desired quality, identifying the suitable physical parameters
of models for the specific simulation conditions. Such an improvement in calibration environmental models can be useful in modern conditions of offshore development and coastal shipping. 
While baseline SPEA2 algorithm shows overfitting due to not taking uncertainty into account, REBEC is based on the  same algorithm with modified fitness functions - it estimates the performance and robustness of the solution with the ensemble of forecasts obtained from several model runs with noised inputs.

How-to-use instructions will be added later.
